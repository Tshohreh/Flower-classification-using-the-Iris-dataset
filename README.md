# Flower-classification-using-the-Iris-dataset
The Iris dataset contains information about three species of flowers, with each sample including four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. We used the Random Forest algorithm for training the model, and for evaluating the model, we utilized a confusion matrix.
